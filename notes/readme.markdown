### Gather your thoughts

This is a place for you to layout your thoughts. Just spread them ideas out. You
could write them in Markdown, but honestly any format will do. It's a good idea
summarize what you'd like to talk about and jot the points down here.

You can link to any [markdown][example] file. Just make sure it's in the `notes`
directory and you'll be all set.

[example]: example.markdown
